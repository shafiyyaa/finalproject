# Final Project Final Project: Implementation of Combination AHP and Group Hare in Student Learning Performance During the Covid-19 Pandemic (Case Study: SMAN 1 Langsa)

During the Covid-19 pandemic, evaluating the performance of teachers at SMAN 1 Langsa becomes crucial in ensuring the best possible learning experience for students. To achieve this, a comprehensive approach was adopted using two methods: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Hare method, both executed with the Microsoft Excel application.

Firstly, 130 students of SMAN 1 Langsa were involved in the AHP evaluation process. Their opinions and feedback on teachers' performance were collected and analyzed using AHP, a widely recognized decision-making technique. This method helps prioritize and rank outstanding teachers based on a structured evaluation of various criteria provided by the students.

Secondly, the Decision Maker's judgments were taken into account to generate teacher rankings using the Hare method. This technique is designed to combine preferences and ratings from the Decision Maker to determine exceptional teachers in the school. Microsoft Excel facilitated the organization and calculation of these rankings, providing a clear and efficient representation of the results.

By implementing these evaluation methodologies, SMAN 1 Langsa aims to identify and appreciate outstanding teachers, recognize their contributions during challenging times, and foster continuous improvement in the teaching quality for the benefit of the students' education.
